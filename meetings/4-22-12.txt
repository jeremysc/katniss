Who are our target customers?
- Shared file spaces

Leyla:
- Papers organized by topic
- Easy to search, intuitive labels
- Presentations and word documents (reports)

Big question:
If the central problem is accessing your files,
and you can do that effectively with a high quality search feature
then how important is:
- where your files are physically
- being able to decide which files are related to each other

Seems like people who are fairly proficient with computers still care about how things are physically organized
They might not organize themselves, but search isn't good enough

For now, take the problem of a folder, shared or not, that is a mess.
Can we help someone organize this folder by suggesting clusters of related files?
