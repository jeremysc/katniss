unsupervised relation extraction

find, read, understand, consolidate, absorb/act

focus: key events, relations between entities, sentiment about entities

fully automate rule building: speed, completeness, quality

unsupervised care2.0, corpus based learning
generic grammar augmented ie, care 2.0
hybrid, care1.0
supervised IE hmm, crf
rule based IE : dial

supervised (HMM vs CRF - local vs global opt), rule-based: lots of human labeling
upenn, some corpus of labeled docs

openie: banko 2008, totally unsupervised

shallow vs. deep parsing (slower, but higher qual)
- their parser is worse at general purpose parsing (vs. cherniak etc.), but better in specific domains
parser -> hpsg, integrates well with NER and POS taggers
- parser from Sag 2003, lingo project
generate single highest weight-parse
worse at parsing general sentences, but better for learning relations within that specific domain
goal: get set of docs for a paritcular domain, then try to learn typical constructs in the domain...totally different grammars from domain-to-domain

parser extends klein and manning 2001 agenda-based parser for pcfg-s

premise is to learn from simple examples, from which relation-related words are weighted heavier, leading to correct parses in the complex case

relation examples:
PersonX has SideEffectY
CompanyX enters into agreement with CompanyY

relations give information about context - gives advantages over lexicon-centric parsing or just relying on NER results

generic grammar - around thirty rules, lexicon def'ns for several hundred words


FLOW: build a grammar in a month
1) parse unlabeled corpus using generic grammar
2) convert frequent patterns into lexical entries, then re-parse using "complete", domain-specific grammar
3) relations extracted are filtered, compared and merged to get rid of redundancy
4) names given to relation types

precision harder than recall

textrunner - UW


system: visual care
0.01% development time for IE system


entity extraction: user feedback required
- trained NER model (CRF)
- manual rules or lexicon definitions
- ex: normalization of references to drugs: Byetta, Pill of byetta, Dose of byetta

- relation clustering: HAC and wordnet


coreference res: relations across many sentences
- lee, 2011 coNLL

use cases:
- sentiment analysis of stocks from news sites
  - stock sonar
    - crawling: learn relevant/irrelevant nodes in dom tree

use beta for strategy
use sentiment signal with technical/fundamental analysis

drug relations, side effects and shared side effects
